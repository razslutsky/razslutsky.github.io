Hi! I'm a Math PhD student at the Weizmann Institute of Science. I'm mainly interested in discrete subgroups of Lie groups. I also like Invariant Random Subgroups and Characters of groups. This has led me recentely to also study operator algebras associated with groups. My supervisor is Prof. Tsachik Gelander.
